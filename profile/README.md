Hi there! Let's contribute to open-source infrastructure automation ðŸ‘‹
---
Here, you can find repositories where [Krestomatio, a managed service for e-learning Moodleâ„¢ platforms](https://krestomatio.com/), publishes or forks open-source projects. Since we focus on automating infrastructure, continuous integration, and delivery (CI/CD), many of these repositories will be related to these topics.
